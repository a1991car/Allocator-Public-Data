    "Brief history of your project and organization": "M3ED is the first multi-sensor event camera (EC) dataset focused on high-speed dynamic motions in robotics applications. M3ED provides high-quality synchronized data from multiple platforms (car, legged robot, UAV), operating in challenging conditions such as off-road trails, dense forests, and performing aggressive flight maneuvers. M3ED also covers demanding operational scenarios for EC, such as high egomotion and multiple independently moving objects. M3ED includes high-resolution stereo EC (1280Ã—720), grayscale and RGB cameras, a high-quality IMU, a 64-beam LiDAR, and RTK localization.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "Multi-robot, Multi-Sensor, Multi-Environment Event Dataset",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "Based on the technical framework from the Filecoin official website and GitHub, we developed our own packaging and ordering systems. Our system is capable of providing 24-hour alerts, and through experimental validation, it is a mature system.\n",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "\nhttps://m3ed.io/data_overview/\n\nResource type\nS3 Bucket\nAmazon Resource Name (ARN)\narn:aws:s3:::m3ed-dist\nAWS Region\nus-west-2\nAWS CLI Access (No AWS account required)\naws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://m3ed-dist/",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Monthly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "More than 3 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, North America, South America, Europe",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "HTTP or FTP server",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f03512458 Hong Kong\nf03512720 Hong Kong\nf03513151 United States\nf03513182 Singapore",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
