    "Brief history of your project and organization": "The United States Air Force (USAF) Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) SSJ precipitating particle instrument measures in-situ total flux and energy distribution of electrons and ions at low earth orbit. These precipitating particles are of interest for space weather operations and research, in part because they produce aurora during normal and very strong geomagnetic storms. This dataset contains both sensor-level raw data (as detailed in Redmon et al. 2017) and a high-level machine-learning-ready data product.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "The United States Air Force (USAF) Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) SSJ precipitating particle instrument measures in-situ total flux and energy distribution of electrons and ions at low earth orbit.

    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "We run our own data processing system.\nBut we will download the dataset according to the AWS command line:\nResources on AWS\nDescription\nDMSP Auroral Particle Flux\nResource type\nS3 Bucket\nAmazon Resource Name (ARN)\narn:aws:s3:::dmspssj\nAWS Region\nus-west-2\nAWS CLI Access (No AWS account required)\naws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://dmspssj/",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "https://registry.opendata.aws/dmspssj/",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "1.5 to 2 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, Asia other than Greater China, Europe, South America, North America",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "Cloud storage (i.e. S3), HTTP or FTP server, Shipping hard drives",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f01926635 SiChuang \nf03284098  HK\nf03253403  ShenZhen \nf03378086   HK\nf03380845 SiChuang\nf02869125 France\nf03358608  HK\nf03408862  HK\nf03312989  HK\nf03499325 HK",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
